<p class="message">
  Howdy! My name is Alec Davila and I built this page to be a board for me to explore new tech, and talk about things that really interest me.
</p>

I'm a well-versed web developer with a passion for writing RESTful services and an exceptional attention to detail. Varied but thorough experience from WordPress, to customized subscriptions with NodeJs and Stripe. Experienced with Python, JavaScript, C++, and PHP. I have a love for open sourced technology, and a desire to contribute.

 I'd like to use this blog to really focus on technologies that are new to me, and especially explore non-web technology. With that said there will still be some tuts that will focus on some more common problems. A lot of tutorials have really helped me out and I hope to possible help others.

 Occasionally some non-tech stuff may fall in here. I'm an avid Tottenham Hotspur fan, and really enjoy Physics and Mathematics. So some of this stuff may find its way in here from time to time.

All tutorials will have either code blocks, or Gists. I'll also include the repositories and commits following along. You can check out my public repositories on my github:

* [FullPint GitHub](https://github.com/fullpint)

While Disqus will be integrated, and I will respond to comments, you can also contact me directly on Twitter or via email.
